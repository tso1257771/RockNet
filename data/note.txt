## Note
1. The `tfrecord_Association/car` and `tfrecord_Association/engineering` contains all training, validation, test data used in the study.
Since the reproduction of these files need all the hourly-long continuous data, which is not available now.

2. The variable names (column titles) of all csv files in ./metadata are described as follows:

	id 			: The id of the events.
	station 		: Available station name of the events.
	labeled_across_stations : Identified as "True" if multiple labels were made over various stations for a single event.
	labels_per_station 	: Number of the labeled waveform of the single-station recordings.
	trace_starttime 	: Start time of the data in UTC(+0).
	trace_endtime		: End time of the data in UTC(+0).
